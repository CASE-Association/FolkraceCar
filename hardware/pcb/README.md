## Notes for Folkrace PCB

### Bring up notes for REV 1-2

* eFuse does not work consistently - two have been broken - unclear why

#### Changes for next rev

* Add way to connect external 5V (protection for DC/DC)
* On off for 3V3 (complete rail)
* Move to edge-mounted buttons
* Check real width of screen (38 mm length)
* Reconnect fault LED to not be on when off
* Change to better switch for on/off operation
* Transient protection and possibly reverse current diode for eFuse
* Check if we can change to Molex nano fit connectors (both connectors oriented towards RP conn)
* Add 90 deg connector for start module
* Flip FAN connector so silkscreen looks good
